Medical information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) https://mimic.physionet.org/about/mimic/
  - Developed my MIT lab, derived from patients admitted to ICUs
  - Single hospital many types of ICU, 53, 423 hospital admissions from 2001-2012, neonates and adults
  - Have released a subset of data to the public
  - Structured and unstructured data elements 
  - Processed to remove all PHI, dates are replaced with fictitious future dates
  - 100 patient dataset is used for the course

Online MIMIC Dictionary describes all MIMIC tables, but not all the columns in the tables
Documentation provides information on the clinical system used to source the data
MIMIC does not harmonize similar data elements from different clinical systems, in this case CareVue vs MetaVision, as would a complete data warehouse

About MIMIC Variables
  - Values in the column subject_id always refer to a specific patient - can be used in join across more than 2 tables
  - All tables have a row_id - do not use row_id in queries !!
  - Subject_id = patient
  - Hadm_id = admission
  - Icustay_id = ICU episode
  - Five tables that start with D_ are dictionary tables,, convert codes into meaningful text

Key things to know about MIMIC-III
  - Table only has subject_id = data relates to a patient
  - Table has both bubjkect_id and hadm_id = data relates to a hospital admission for a patient
  - Table has subject_id, hadm_id, and icustay_id = data relates to an ICU episode during an admission for a patient
  - subject_id and hadm_id give us the "per patient per admission" for a query

OMOP Data Model
  - Two models that are merged together: source (local) and standard (network)
  - Source (local) stores original data value as it exists from orignating source
  - Standard (network) is data that is mapped into a standard format
  - Source must be mapped to standard terms
  - Term hierarchy or Classification terms - supports multiple classifications
  - Source code can be ICD-10, SNOEMED, MeSH --> mapped to SNOMED-CT (for standard mapping)
  - OHDSI provides mapping between SNOMED-CT to MedDRA terms (for FDA)
  - Multiple temrinology hierarchies allow for constructing queries for medications based on: 1) indication, 2) ingredient, or 3) drug class
  - NDFRT - National Drug File Reference Temrinology - produced and supported by the VA, open-source
  - OMOP standard terminology: maintain mappings from non-standard to standard concepts (ex. ICD10-CM to SNOWMED-CT
  - OHDSI has many terminologies that are maintained
  - Source_value hold values present int he original source before any mapping
  - concept_id are OMOP standard values, harmonizes local-to-network 
  - hierarchies only available for standard terminologies, not source values
  
Querying OMOP Data
  - Standardize clinical data, health system data, health economics, dervied elements, meta-data, and vocabularies
  - source_value and source_concept_id = raw MIMIC-III values; source_concept_id = original MIMIC code and concept_id = OMOP's standard code
  - concept_id are value for OMOP standard concepts --> use for queries
  - concept_ancestor = table store concept hierarchies, use parent (general) concept as ancestor concept_id
  - Atlas tool provides graphical format of the parent and children concepts 
  
Key things to know about OMOP
  - visit_occurence = admissions
  - condition_occurrence = diagnoses
  - drug_exposure = medication prescription of fulfillment
  - How many patients? SELECT count(distinct person_id) AS num_pts FROM mimic3_demo_omop_c.person
  - How many admissions? SELECT count(distinct visit)occurrence_id) AS num_admissions FROM mimic3_demo_omop_c.visit_occurrence
  
MIMIC vs OMOP
  - MIMIC is ICU only, little info about hospitalization, admission-centric, uses seperate tables for each data source
  - OMOP is for hospital, clinics, and many care settings, uses individual table to store data that are merged form multiple data sources
  - MIMIC only stores original values. OMOP stores original values in the source_value and source_concept_id fields
  - PATIENTS in MIMIC; PERSON in OMOP
  - Computer abstractions: MIMIC does not use computed abstractions; OMOP uses computer abstractions for observation period, drug era, condition_Era, and Cohot (a gorup of patients who are common set of characteristics
  - MIMIC has no hierarchy for terms OMOP uses hirarchies to organize terms
  - MIMIC is optimize the integrity of original data sources - allows data science to make decisions about data harmonization
  - OMOP is optimized to support large international big networks, data transformation is done once, data scientists accept whatever decisions were made to map into standardized models
  
OHDSI is the group that support the OMOP data
  - Innovation, Reproducibility, Community, Collaboration, Openness, Beneficence
  - Video tutorials for OMOP CDM (R packages)
