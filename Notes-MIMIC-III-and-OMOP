Medical information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) https://mimic.physionet.org/about/mimic/
  - Developed my MIT lab, derived from patients admitted to ICUs
  - Single hospital many types of ICU, 53, 423 hospital admissions from 2001-2012, neonates and adults
  - Have released a subset of data to the public
  - Structured and unstructured data elements 
  - Processed to remove all PHI, dates are replaced with fictitious future dates
  - 100 patient dataset is used for the course

Online MIMIC Dictionary describes all MIMIC tables, but not all the columns in the tables
Documentation provides information on the clinical system used to source the data
MIMIC does not harmonize similar data elements from different clinical systems, in this case CareVue vs MetaVision, as would a complete data warehouse

About MIMIC Variables
  - Values in the column subject_id always refer to a specific patient - can be used in join across more than 2 tables
  - All tables have a row_id - do not use row_id in queries !!
  - Subject_id = patient
  - Hadm_id = admission
  - Icustay_id = ICU episode
  - Five tables that start with D_ are dictionary tables,, convert codes into meaningful text

Key things to know about MIMIC-III
  - Table only has subject_id = data relates to a patient
  - Table has both bubjkect_id and hadm_id = data relates to a hospital admission for a patient
  - Table has subject_id, hadm_id, and icustay_id = data relates to an ICU episode during an admission for a patient
  - subject_id and hadm_id give us the "per patient per admission" for a query

OMOP Data Model
  - Two models that are merged together: source (local) and standard (network)
  - Source (local) stores original data value as it exists from orignating source
  - Standard (network) is data that is mapped into a standard format
  - Source must be mapped to standard terms
  - Term hierarchy or Classification terms - supports multiple classifications
  - Source code can be ICD-10, SNOEMED, MeSH --> mapped to SNOMED-CT (for standard mapping)
  - OHDSI provides mapping between SNOMED-CT to MedDRA terms (for FDA)
  - Multiple temrinology hierarchies allow for constructing queries for medications based on: 1) indication, 2) ingredient, or 3) drug class
  - NDFRT - National Drug File Reference Temrinology - produced and supported by the VA, open-source
  - OMOP standard terminology: maintain mappings from non-standard to standard concepts (ex. ICD10-CM to SNOWMED-CT
  - OHDSI has many terminologies that are maintained
  - Source_value hold values present int he original source before any mapping
  - concept_id are OMOP standard values, harmonizes local-to-network 
  - hierarchies only available for standard terminologies, not source values
