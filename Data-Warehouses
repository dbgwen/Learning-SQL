## Key features of a data warehouse
  - Subject-oriented: data elements that relate to common real-world "objects" are logically interrelated
  - Time-variant: changes in data over time can be tracked and reported on
  - Non-volatile: data is permanent
  - Integrated: data is comprehensive and consistent

## Storing Diverse Data
  - Data elements need to be stored (what tables, how are they connected)
  - Same data elements need a common name
  - Different data elements need a different name (appt vs visit, order vs results, prescription vs medication files)
