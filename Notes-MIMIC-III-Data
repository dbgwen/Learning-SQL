Medical information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) https://mimic.physionet.org/about/mimic/
  - Developed my MIT lab, derived from patients admitted to ICUs
  - Single hospital many types of ICU, 53, 423 hospital admissions from 2001-2012, neonates and adults
  - Have released a subset of data to the public
  - Structured and unstructured data elements 
  - Processed to remove all PHI, dates are replaced with fictitious future dates
  - 100 patient dataset is used for the course

Online MIMIC Dictionary describes all MIMIC tables, but not all the columns in the tables
Documentation provides information on the clinical system used to source the data
MIMIC does not harmonize similar data elements from different clinical systems, in this case CareVue vs MetaVision, as would a complete data warehouse
