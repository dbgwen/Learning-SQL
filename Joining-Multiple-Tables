SQL is a relational databse that allows a user to work with multiple tables of data

    SELECT *
    FROM table1
    LIMIT 5;

    SELECT *
    FROM table2
    LIMIT 5;

    SELECT * 
    FROM table3
    LIMIT 5;
    
* JOIN two tables on a common variables
    
    SELECT *
    FROM table1
    JOIN table2
      ON table1.variable_id = table2.variable_id;

    1. The first line selects all columns from our combined table. If we only want to select certain columns, we can specify which ones we want
    2. The second line specifies the first table that we want to look in, table1
    3. The third line uses JOIN to say that we want to combine information from table1 with table2
    4. The fourth line tells us how to combine the two tables. We want to match table1’s variable_id column with table2’s variable_id column

    Because column names are often repeated across multiple tables, we use the syntax table_name.column_name
    
    SELECT *
    FROM table1
    JOIN table2
      ON table1.variable_id = table2.variable_id
    WHERE table2.variable_name = 'text'; 
    
* Inner JOIN
  
  When we perform a simple JOIN (often called an inner join) our result only includes rows that match our ON condition
