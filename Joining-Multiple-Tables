SQL is a relational databse that allows a user to work with multiple tables of data

    SELECT *
    FROM table1
    LIMIT 5;

    SELECT *
    FROM table2
    LIMIT 5;

    SELECT * 
    FROM table3
    LIMIT 5;
    
* JOIN two tables on a common variables
    
    SELECT *
    FROM table1
    JOIN table2
      ON table1.variable_id = table2.variable_id;

    1. The first line selects all columns from our combined table. If we only want to select certain columns, we can specify which ones we want
    2. The second line specifies the first table that we want to look in, table1
    3. The third line uses JOIN to say that we want to combine information from table1 with table2
    4. The fourth line tells us how to combine the two tables. We want to match table1’s variable_id column with table2’s variable_id column

    Because column names are often repeated across multiple tables, we use the syntax table_name.column_name
    
    SELECT *
    FROM table1
    JOIN table2
      ON table1.variable_id = table2.variable_id
    WHERE table2.variable_name = 'text'; 
    
* Inner JOIN
  
  When we perform a simple JOIN (often called an inner join) our result only includes rows that match our ON condition
  
* Left JOIN

  The final result will keep all rows of the first table but will omit the un-matched row from the second table
  
    SELECT *
    FROM table1
    LEFT JOIN table2
      ON table1.c2 = table2.c2;
    
    1. The first line selects all columns from both tables.
    2. The second line selects table1 (the “left” table)
    3. The third line performs a LEFT JOIN on table2 (the “right” table)
    4. The fourth line tells SQL how to perform the join (by looking for matching values in column c2).

  Add a WHERE clause to the above query to include the null values for the left table
  
  * Primary Key
  
    Primary keys have a few requirements:
    - None of the values can be NULL
    - Each value must be unique (i.e., you can’t have two customers with the same customer_id in the customers table)
    - A table can not have more than one primary key column
    
    When a Primary Key appears in a different table is it called a 'Foreign Key'
    Note: The most common types of joins will be joining a foreign key from one table with the primary key from another table
