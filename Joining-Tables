## JOINing Tables
    
   ** Inner Join - only joins tables with mathcing variables
          SELECT customers.name, orders.item FROM customers JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

          SELECT persons.name, hobbies.name FROM persons JOIN hobbies ON persons.id = hobbies.person_id; 

          SELECT persons.name, hobbies.name FROM persons JOIN hobbies ON persons.id = hobbies.person_id WHERE persons.name='Bobby McBobbyFace';
      
  ** Outer Join - the left tells SQL to retain every row from the left table (the one after FROM; and retain the rows even if there is no match in the table; the right outer join keep severything form the table on the right of the FROM command; Full Outer Join - matches rows on the right and left side and will fill in NULLS if missing

          SELECT customers.name, orders.item FROM customers LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
          SELECT customers.name, customers.email, orders.item, orders.price FROM customers LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

          SELECT customers.name, customers.email, orders.item, orders.price FROM customers LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id; 

          SELECT customers.name, customers.email, SUM(orders.price) AS total_spent FROM customers LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id GROUP BY customers.name ORDER BY total_spent desc; 

  ** Self-Joins - joining columns to each other from a table
           SELECT id, first_name, last_name, buddy_id FROM students; 
           SELECT first_name, last_name, buddies.email FROM students JOIN students buddies ON students.buddy_id = buddies.id;
           SELECT movies.title as Title, sequel.title as Sequel FROM movies LEFT OUTER JOIN movies sequel ON movies.sequel_id = sequel.id; 

  ** Combining Multiple Tables
           SELECT a.title, b.title FROM project_pairs JOIN student_projects a 
           ON project_pairs.project1_id = a.id
           JOIN student_projects b
           ON project_pairs.project2_id = b.id
           
           SELECT a.fullname, b.name FROM persons a JOIN hobbies b ON a.id = b.person_id;
