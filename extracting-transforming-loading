The task of extraction and transformation and loading or ETL which is necessary to convert clinical data which is available in a local data model into a format that conforms to a common data model that can support large scale multi-institutional real world data analytics.

  - Extraction phase focuses on getting data out of the source database
  - Transformation phase focuses on changes needed to the data elements to divert from the local structures to the common data model structures
